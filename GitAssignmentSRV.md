# GitHub Reading Assignment
![GitHub Logo](github_logo.png)
1. GitHub is a really powerful tool that i am looking forward to learning

2. The reading was very informative. The provided markdown file gave me some basic information about Git (repositories, forks, pull requests, ect.) and even helped me create this markdown file.

3. At minimum I have already learned two things:
- how to create a fork (unfortunately i couldn't accept this assignment normally)
- how to clone a github repository

3. I am looking forward to doing further research into the use of github so I can easily keep track of projects :computer:
- I'm not sure if the emoji above will render correctly so just in case here is a copy and pasted one ðŸ’»
